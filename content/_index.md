Hey! 

It looks like you found my homepage.
I am Oli Ro√ü (they/them), a computer scientist from Innsbruck, Austria.

After completing a BSc. in Physics at the University of Innsbruck, I'm now enrolled in the Master's program of Computer Science. 
My focus is on information security, privacy and machine learning. 

I'm currently working on my master thesis on replicating the [membership inference attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05820) against machine learning models.
You can track my current progress [here](https://github.com/Oli-Ross/replicating_mia).
