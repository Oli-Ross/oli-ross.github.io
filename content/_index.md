Hey! 

It looks like you found my homepage.
I am Oli Ro√ü (they/them), a computer scientist from Innsbruck, Austria.

After completing a BSc. in Physics, I'm about to finish my Master's degree in Computer Science, both at the University of Innsbruck.
My focus was on information security, privacy and machine learning. 

I recently completed my Master's thesis on replicating the [membership inference attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05820) against machine learning models,
you can check out the code [here](https://github.com/Oli-Ross/replicating_mia).

Other previous projects include a [mini-C compiler](https://github.com/Oli-Ross/mcc) written in C or hacking together [a bunch of build scripts](https://github.com/Oli-Ross/ArchPatches) for Arch Linux to adapt some programs to my needs.

I am currently looking for a job, feel free to [contact me](mailto:mail@oliross.at).
