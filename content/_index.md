Hey! 

It looks like you found my homepage.

My name is **Oli Ro√ü** (they/them) and I am a data scientist in Innsbruck, Austria, working remotely at Good Research in Berkeley, USA, where I do data and privacy analyses.

I earned a BSc. in **Physics** and an MSc. in **Computer Science**, both at the University of Innsbruck. My focus was on **information security, privacy and adversarial machine learning**.
Recently, I completed my Master's thesis on replicating the [membership inference attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05820) against machine learning models, you can check out the code [here](https://github.com/Oli-Ross/replicating_mia).

I love learning and am currently broadening my understanding of information security and privacy.
Don't hesitate to [**contact me**](mailto:mail@oliross.at).
