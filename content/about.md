I am Oliver Ro√ü, a Computer scientist from Innsbruck, Austria.

After completing a BSc. in Physics at the University of Innsbruck, I enrolled for
the Master's program of Computer Science. 
Here my focus has been on information
security, cryptography and machine learning. 

My tools of choice include C, Python and Bash.

Currently I am working on my master thesis on generating adverarial images for
neural networks in the frequency domain.
