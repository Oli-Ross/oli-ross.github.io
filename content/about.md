I am Oliver Ro√ü, a Computer scientist from Innsbruck, Austria.

After completing a BSc. in Physics at the University of Innsbruck, I enrolled for
the Master's program of Computer Science. 
Here, my focus has been on information
security, cryptography and machine learning. 

I have experience with C, Python and Bash. During my studies I use
Latex extensively, also for presentations with `beamer` and `tikz`.

Currently I am working on my master thesis on replicating the [membership inference attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05820) against machine learning models.
