After completing a BSc. in Physics at the University of Innsbruck, I enrolled for the Master&amp;rsquo;s program of Computer Science. Here, my focus has been on information security, cryptography and machine learning.
I have experience with C, Python and Bash. During my studies I use Latex extensively, also for presentations with beamer and tikz.
Currently I am working on my master thesis on replicating the membership inference attack against machine learning models.</description></item></channel></rss>
